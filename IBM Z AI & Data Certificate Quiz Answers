Questions and Answers:

1. Db2 Analytics Accelerator has the following form factors which can be selected by customers. (Select all that apply)*
Choose as many as you like
A Accelerator on z16 & LinuxONE
B Netezza
C Accelerator on AWS
D Accelerator on IBM Cloud

The correct form factors for Db2 Analytics Accelerator that customers can select are:
A. Accelerator on z16 & LinuxONE
C. Accelerator on AWS
D. Accelerator on IBM Cloud

Explanation:
Db2 Analytics Accelerator can be deployed on z16 & LinuxONE for on-prem solutions and also on cloud platforms like AWS and IBM Cloud.
Netezza is a different IBM data warehousing appliance and isn't a form factor for Db2 Analytics Accelerator itself.


2. SSC Stands for.*
A Social Security Commitment
B Secure Service Compliant
c Secure Service Container
D Selected Services for Container

The correct answer is:
C. Secure Service Container

Explanation:
Secure Service Container (SSC) is a technology by IBM that provides a secure environment for running workloads, focusing on 
security and encryption for data and applications without requiring changes to the application itself.


3. Db2 AI for z/OS uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to *
Select only one option 
A Optimize SQL performance
B Increase Db2 for z/OS subsystem health and resiliency
c Control the remote access to Db2 for z/OS
D None of the above
E All of the above

The correct answer is:
A. Optimize SQL performance

Explanation:
Db2 AI for z/OS uses machine learning to analyze SQL queries and optimize their performance automatically. It 
helps improve query execution efficiency without requiring manual tuning. It doesn't directly manage subsystem 
health, resiliency, or access control.


4. Db2 AI for z/OS combines machine learning and domain knowledge to enhance Db2 for z/OS operations*
A True
B False

The correct answer is:
A. True

Explanation:
Db2 AI for z/OS integrates machine learning with expert domain knowledge to optimize various Db2 for z/OS operations, 
such as SQL performance and workload management, enhancing overall efficiency and operational performance.


5. Machine Learning and Deep Learning models must be built and trained on IBM z16 processor in order to derive insights from data in real-time.*
A True
B False

The correct answer is:
B. False

Explanation:
Machine Learning and Deep Learning models do not need to be built or trained specifically on IBM z16 processors to derive 
insights from data in real-time. These models can be developed on various platforms and then deployed on IBM z16 for 
real-time processing, but the training can happen elsewhere, like on cloud or other computing environments.


6. Db2 z/OS SQL Data Insights uses the following approach to train a large database model from a relational database table*
A Supervised training with labelled data✓
B Self-supervised training
c Regression Models
D Gradient-boosted Trees

The correct answer is:
B. Self-supervised training

Explanation:
Db2 z/OS SQL Data Insights uses self-supervised training, which allows the model to learn patterns from the data without 
requiring labeled data, making it scalable for large relational database tables. It identifies patterns and relationships
automatically, suitable for complex SQL queries and data insights.


7. Which AI capabilities are offered on IBM Z platform? (Select all that apply)*
Choose as many as you like
A Leverage popular open source frameworks such as TensorFlow, ONNX, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.
B IBM Deep Learning Compiler (DLC) that generates a program optimized for performance by executing on-chip AI accelerator.
C watsonx code assistant for Z - generative AI-assisted offering that accelerates the translation of COBOL to Java on IBM Z.
D Watson Machine Learning for z/OS (WMLz) - a powerful suite of easy- to-use tools that support a full lifecycle management of AI models.
E None of the above
D All of the above

The correct AI capabilities offered on the IBM Z platform are:
D All of the above

Explanation:
IBM Z supports popular open-source frameworks and has specialized tools like DLC for optimized AI model execution and WMLz 
for full AI lifecycle management. It also provides watsonx code assistant for generative AI-assisted COBOL-to-Java translation.


8. Which of the following is not an IBM z16 on-chip accelerator use case? (Select all that apply)*
A Fraud detection
B Powerball Lottery number prediction 
c Anti-money Laundering
D Clearing & Settlement in transactions

The correct answer is:
B. Powerball Lottery number prediction

Explanation:
The IBM z16 on-chip accelerator is designed for real-time, high-performance processing in use cases like fraud detection, 
anti-money laundering, and clearing & settlement in transactions. However, Powerball Lottery number prediction is not a 
practical or relevant use case for this technology.


9. Machine learning/artificial intelligence models provide the least value when*
A Implemented within production systems
B Deployed for real-time execution
c Driving decisions for each individual transaction
D On a chart hung on the wall

The correct answer is:
D. On a chart hung on the wall

Explanation:
Machine learning and artificial intelligence models provide the least value when they are merely displayed on a 
chart and not actively implemented in production systems, deployed for real-time execution, or used to drive 
decisions. Their value lies in their application and integration into decision-making processes, not just in 
documentation or visual representations.


10. Db2 z/OS SQL Data Insight provides capability to call inferencing of the foundational model in SQL using Built-in- Functions (BIFs)*
A True
B False

The correct answer is:
A. True

Explanation:
Db2 z/OS SQL Data Insight does provide the capability to call inferencing of the foundational model in SQL 
using Built-in Functions (BIFs). This allows users to leverage AI models directly within SQL queries, enabling 
advanced data insights and analytics within the Db2 environment.
