- **Security Operations** (28%)
- **Security Program Management and Oversight** (20%)

- You will have 90 minutes to answer up to 90 questions, which include multiple-choice questions and a few multiple-select questions requiring you to pick 2 or 3 correct answers for a single question. 
- Additionally, you will encounter a handful of performance-based questions. -
- To pass the Security+ certification exam, you need a minimum score of 750 points out of 900 on their 100 to 900 point scale.

## Exam Tips

- There won't be any trick questions. However, watch out for distractors or red herrings among the listed possible answer choices, as at least one is usually meant to distract you from the correct answer.
- Pay attention to words in **bold**, *italics*, or ALL UPPERCASE.
- Base your answers on CompTIA Security+ knowledge. In cybersecurity, there are no 100% correct answers in the real world due to situational contexts. When in doubt, choose the answer that is correct for the highest number of situations.
- Understand the key concepts of the test questions instead of memorizing terms word for word.
