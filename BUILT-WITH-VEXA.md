**Build your meeting assistant or flow in hours - not months!**

Vexa is your foundation for building intelligent meeting solutions. Here's what you can create:

- **Meeting Assistants**: Your own Otter.ai/Fireflies.ai with real-time transcription and translation
- **Sales Intelligence**: Automated call analyzers for tracking objections and follow-ups
- **Meeting Analytics**: Tools for analyzing participation and engagement
- **Automated Workflows**: n8n flows for auto-summaries, follow-ups, and CRM updates

The Vexa API provides powerful abstractions and a clear separation of concerns, enabling you to build sophisticated applications on top with a safe and enjoyable coding experience. 

For instance, the **Vexa Example Client** was built in just 3 hours of live coding with Cursor, showcasing the rapid development possible with Vexa.

Furthermore, with our **n8n integration**, you can create incredibly complex workflows with no code, leveraging real-time transcription from Google Meet (with support for other platforms coming soon).
